I hold a Ph.D. in philosophy from Universidad de los Andes (Colombia). I did my bachelors and masters studies at Universidad del Rosario (Colombia). My research interests include the political and feminist philosophy of science, the science and values debate, and social and feminist epistemology. In my dissertation I focused on the epistemic and social relevance of geographic diversity to address the values that pervade global science, the geopolitical dimensions of the production of scientific knowledge, and conceiving possible ameliorative strategies to face the different faces of epistemic oppression towards scientific communities in low- and middle-income countries.
